                    As society marches towards an ever increasingly globalized community, it
                    becomes more imperative that we help students better understand the interconnected nature of

                    history is created and ridding the scope and sequence of excessive regional divisions traditionally found in
                    World and American history programs.

                    This course introduces you to the range of American literature. You will explore the American
                    impulse toward rebellion and the importance of place in defining self. While the texts are set in a
                    specific historical moment, you will consider as well how the texts transcend their times.
                    Through literary genres of novels, plays, essays, short stories, personal narratives, and poetry,
                    techniques of critical analysis and interpretation will be introduced and applied in classroom
                    discussions, oral presentations, and multimedia projects with each unit culminating in a final
                    written paper. Additionally, throughout the year, students develop vocabulary and grammar
                    through quizzes and reading.

                    <p>Capture the Flags (CTFs) are hacking competitions with challenges that range from
                        breaking into websites to uncovering hidden data to reverse-engineering algorithms.
                        Besides being a great way to get into cybersecurity, the competitions are exciting,
                        and the community is fun! In CTF club, we will focus on understanding how these
                        challenges work and build intuition for how to solve them, delving into web
                        exploitation, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and forensics.
                        These skills will enable you to form your own teams to succeed in other CTFs.
                        Must have some programming experience or have other CS background with
                        instructor approval.</p>

                    materials, resources, and assistance to begin folding all types of models - flowers,
                    animals, and action models, all of which can be taken home or gifted to others. For
                    beginners, there will be a series of tutorials and models to fold that gradually
                    increase in difficulty to naturally introduce you into the art, but for anybody just
                    looking for some peace of mind, we allow students to spend the time to fold
                    whatever they like, from any diagrams or books provided, or from youtube videos!
                    We will also create some group models, where everybody can fold a few pieces that
                    will be connected to create a bigger piece! No experience required - all you need is
                    a piece of paper, two hands, and a bit of patience.</p>
